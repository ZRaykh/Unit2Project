LinearEquation class

Step 1. Import and define Decimal Format and create four new private double variables (xOne, yOne, xTwo, yTwo)
        Also make two private strings (pointOne, pointTwo)

Step 2. Make the constructor "public LinearEquation" which will have double parameters in this order:
        (xOne, yOne, xTwo, yTwo) and String parameters (pointOne, pointTwo)
        A. using a this. statement make sure the variables in Step 1 equal the parameters in step 2.

Step 3. Make "public double slopeNumerical" that will plug in xOne, yOne, xTwo, yTwo into slope a slope formula and
        return the slope as a decimal.

Step 4. Make "public String slopeFractional" that will do the same as "public double slopeNumerical" except return the
        slope in proper fraction form, this will be useful for printing later.

Step 5. Make a "public double yIntercept" that will find the y intercept, aka the value when X = 0. This will return
        the y intercept.

Step 6. Make a "public String makeEquation" that will return the formatted linear equation.
        "y = " + slopeFractional + "x" + yIntercept.

Step 7. Make a "public double distance" that will return the distances between both coordinate points rounded to the
        nearest hundredth

Step 8. Make a "public String toString()" method to return pointOne, pointTwo, slopeFractional, yIntercept, makeEquation,
        and distance as one large text.

Step 9. Make a "void coordinates(double x)" that will calculate the y point to any entered x using the slopeNumberical and yIntercept.
        Then print the x and y points as a String in (x,y) format. This program will have one parameter called x which
        Is a double.

EquationRunner.java

 Step 1. Set up main and scanner class, name scanner under variable S.

 Step 2. Ask the user to input the first set of coordinate points in the format of (x,y) and all numbers being integers
         A. store this under String "pointOne"

 Step 3. Get the second set of coordinate points from the user, same format as step 2.
         A. store this under String "pointTwo"

 Step 4. Split the first coordinate point (pointOne) into a x and y value
         A. Using index of string, fine the position of the "," in pointOne, store this in value int "comma"
         B. Create new double "xOne" with the x values from pointOne: use the two parameter substring method going from
         1 to the index of"comma," this will leave only the x value which will then be converted into a double via
         Double.parseDouble and stored under "xOne," the substring takes the comma value and goes to it - 1, which means
         the "," will be removed
         C. Create new double "yOne" with the y value from pointOne: using the two parameter substring method start at
         index "comma" + 1 and end at length()-1 of pointOne since we want to remove the ")" at the end

 Step 5. Split the second coordinate point (pointTwo) into a x and y value
         A. Using the same method in Step 4, except store values in xTwo and yTwo and use pointTwo for the location
         of the comma and length of string.

 Step 6. Create a new object "equation" with parameters entered in this order xOne, yOne, xTwo, yTwo, pointOne, pointTwo

 Step 7. Print the object "equation"

 Step 8. Ask the user for any x coordinate point, store it in xThree and call the equation.coordinates void method
         with a parameter of the user's inputed x.
